# publication-parallel-bug-for-ttns

This repository collects the numerical test cases for the manuscript "Parallel Basis Update and Galerkin Integrator for Tree Tensor Networks". All numerical experiments are computed with Julia, Version 1.10.4. To run all experiments, simply go into one of the directories and type julia main.jl into the command line. This will install all required packages, run all computations, and reproduce all figures from the manuscript.
